# Laminas Transfer

Library to transfer ZF repositories to Laminas Project.

## Usage

Use the following command to calculate the order of repositories to transfer:

```console
$ bin/console dependencies <org> <github token>
```

Generate github token on: https://github.com/settings/tokens

Then to transfer the repository use the command:

```console
$ bin/console transfer <org>/<name> <path>
```

It is recommended to use RamDisk as a path for better performance.

It will clone the repository and rewrite the entire history (all commits)
by replacing all references to ZendFramework with Laminas.
