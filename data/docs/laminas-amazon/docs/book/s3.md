# `Laminas\Amazon\S3`

Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to
store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the
web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable,
reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses
to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize
benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.

## Registering with Amazon S3

Before you can get started with `Laminas\Amazon\S3`, you must first
register for an account. Please see the [S3
FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/) page on the Amazon website for more
information.

After registering, you will receive an application key and a secret key.
You will need both to access the S3 service.

## API Documentation

The `Laminas\Amazon\S3` class provides the PHP wrapper to the
Amazon S3 REST interface. Please consult the
[Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html)
for detailed description of the service. You will need to be familiar
with basic concepts in order to use this service.

## Features

`Laminas\Amazon\S3` provides the following functionality:

- A single point for configuring your amazon.s3 authentication
  credentials that can be used across the amazon.s3 namespaces.
- A proxy object that is more convenient to use than an HTTP
  client alone, mostly removing the need to manually construct
  HTTP POST requests to access the REST service.
- A response wrapper that parses each response body and throws an
  exception if an error occurred, alleviating the need to repeatedly
  check the success of many commands.
- Additional convenience methods for some of the more common
  operations.

## Getting Started

Once you have registered with Amazon S3, you're ready to store your
first data object on the S3. The objects on S3 are stored in containers,
called "buckets". Bucket names are unique on S3, and each user can have
no more than 100 buckets simultaneously. Each bucket can contain
unlimited amount of objects, identified by name.

The following example demonstrates creating a bucket, storing and
retrieving the data.

### `Laminas\Amazon\S3` Usage Example

```php
$s3 = new Laminas\Amazon\S3($myAwsKey, $myAwsSecretKey);
$s3->createBucket('my-own-bucket');
$s3->putObject('my-own-bucket/myobject', 'somedata');

echo $s3->getObject('my-own-bucket/myobject');
```

Since `Laminas\Amazon\S3` service requires authentication, you
should pass your credentials (AWS key and secret key) to the
constructor. If you only use one account, you can set default
credentials for the service:

```php
Laminas\Amazon\S3::setKeys($myAwsKey, $myAwsSecretKey);
$s3 = new Laminas\Amazon\S3();
```

## Bucket operations

All objects in S3 system are stored in buckets. Bucket has to be created
before any storage operation. Bucket name is unique in the system, so
you can not have bucket named the same as someone else's bucket.

Bucket name can contain lowercase letters, digits, periods (`.`),
underscores (`_`), and dashes (`-`). No other symbols allowed. Bucket name
should start with letter or digit, and be 3 to 255 characters long.
Names looking like an IP address (e.g. `192.168.16.255`) are not
allowed.

- `createBucket()` creates a new bucket.
- `cleanBucket()` removes all objects that are contained in a bucket.
- `removeBucket()` removes the bucket from the system. The bucket
  should be empty to be removed.

  **Bucket Removal Example**

  ```php
  $s3 = new Laminas\Amazon\S3($myAwsKey, $myAwsSecretKey);

  $s3->cleanBucket('my-own-bucket');
  $s3->removeBucket('my-own-bucket');
  ```

- `getBuckets()` returns the list of the names of all buckets
  belonging to the user.

  **Bucket Listing Example**

  ```php
  $s3 = new Laminas\Amazon\S3($myAwsKey, $myAwsSecretKey);

  $list = $s3->getBuckets();
  foreach ($list as $bucket) {
      echo "I have bucket $bucket\n";
  }
  ```

- `isBucketAvailable()` check if the bucket exists and returns `true`
  if it does.

## Object operations

The object is the basic storage unit in S3. Object stores unstructured
data, which can be any size up to 4 gigabytes. There's no limit on how
many objects can be stored on the system.

The object are contained in buckets. Object is identified by name, which
can be any utf-8 string. It is common to use hierarchical names (such as
`Pictures/Myself/CodingInPHP.jpg`) to organise object names. Object name
is prefixed with bucket name when using object functions, so for object
`mydata` in bucket `my-own-bucket` the name would be
`my-own-bucket/mydata`.

Objects can be replaced (by rewriting new data with the same key) or
deleted, but not modified, appended, etc. Object is always stored whole.

By default, all objects are private and can be accessed only by their
owner. However, it is possible to specify object with public access, in
which case it will be available through the URL:
`https://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]/[object-name]`.

- `putObject($object, $data, $meta)` created an object with name
  `$object` (should contain the bucket name as prefix!) having `$data`
  as its content.

  Optional `$meta` parameter is the array of metadata, which currently
  supports the following parameters as keys:

  - `S3_CONTENT_TYPE_HEADER`
    MIME content type of the data. If not specified, the type will
    be guessed according to the file extension of the object name.

  - `S3_ACL_HEADER`
    The access to the item. Following access constants can be used:

    - `S3_ACL_PRIVATE`
      Only the owner has access to the item.

    - `S3_ACL_PUBLIC_READ`
      Anybody can read the object, but only owner can write.
      This is setting may be used to store publicly accessible content.

    - `S3_ACL_PUBLIC_WRITE`
      Anybody can read or write the object. This policy is rarely useful.
    
    - `S3_ACL_AUTH_READ`
      Only the owner has write access to the item, and other authenticated
      S3 users have read access. This is useful for sharing data between S3
      accounts without exposing them to the public.

  By default, all the items are private.

  **Public Object Example**

  ```php
  $s3 = new Laminas\Amazon\S3($myAwsKey, $myAwsSecretKey);

  $s3->putObject(
      'my-own-bucket/Pictures/Me.png',
      file_get_contents('me.png'),
      [Laminas\Amazon\S3::S3_ACL_HEADER => Laminas\Amazon\S3::S3_ACL_PUBLIC_READ]
  );

  // or:
  $s3->putFile(
      'me.png',
      'my-own-bucket/Pictures/Me.png',
      [Laminas\Amazon\S3::S3_ACL_HEADER => Laminas\Amazon\S3::S3_ACL_PUBLIC_READ]
  );
  
  echo "Go to https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-own-bucket/Pictures/Me.png to see me!\n";
  ```

- `getObject($object)` retrieves object data from the storage by name.
- `removeObject($object)` removes the object from the storage.
- `getInfo($object)` retrieves the metadata information about the
  object. The function will return array with metadata information.
  Some of the useful keys are:

  - `type` The *MIME* type of the item.
  - `size` The size of the object data.
  - `mtime` UNIX-type timestamp of the last modification for the object.
  - `etag` The ETag of the data, which is the MD5 hash of the data, surrounded by quotes (`"`).
  
  The function will return `false` if the key does not correspond to any existing object.

- `getObjectsByBucket($bucket)` returns the list of the object keys, contained in the bucket.

  **Object Listing Example**

  ```php
  $s3 = new Laminas\Amazon\S3($myAwsKey, $myAwsSecretKey);

  $list = $s3->getObjectsByBucket('my-own-bucket');

  foreach ($list as $name) {
      echo "I have $name key:\n";
      $data = $s3->getObject("my-own-bucket/$name");
      echo "with data: $data\n";
  }
  ```

- `isObjectAvailable($object)` checks if the object with given name exists.
- `putFile($path, $object, $meta)` puts the content of the file in
  `$path` into the object named `$object`.

  The optional `$meta` argument is the same as for `putObject`. If the
  content type is omitted, it will be guessed basing on the source
  file name.

## Data Streaming

It is possible to get and put objects using not stream data held in
memory but files or PHP streams. This is especially useful when file
sizes are large in order not to overcome memory limits.

To receive object using streaming, use method
`getObjectStream($object, $filename)`. This method will return
`Laminas\Http\Response\Stream`, which can be used as described in
[HTTP Client Data Streaming](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-http/client/advanced/#data-streaming)
section.

**Data Streaming Example**

```php
$response = $amazon->getObjectStream('mybycket/laminastest');

// copy file
copy($response->getStreamName(), 'my/downloads/file');

// use stream
$fp = fopen('my/downloads/file2', 'w');
stream_copy_to_stream($response->getStream(), $fp);
```

Second parameter for `getObjectStream()` is optional and specifies
target file to write the data. If not specified, temporary file is used,
which will be deleted after the response object is destroyed.

To send object using streaming, use `putFileStream()` which has the same
signature as `putFile()` but will use streaming and not read the file
into memory.

Also, you can pass stream resource to `putObject()` method data
parameter, in which case the data will be read from the stream when
sending the request to the server.

## Stream wrapper

In addition to the interfaces described above, `Laminas\Amazon\S3`
also supports operating as a stream wrapper. For this, you need to
register the client object as the stream wrapper:

**Streams Example**

```php
$s3 = new Laminas\Amazon\S3($myAwsKey, $myAwsSecretKey);
$s3->registerStreamWrapper('s3');

mkdir('s3://my-own-bucket');
file_put_contents('s3://my-own-bucket/testdata', 'mydata');

echo file_get_contents('s3://my-own-bucket/testdata');
```

Directory operations (`mkdir`, `rmdir`, `opendir`, etc.) will operate on
buckets and thus their arguments should be of the form of
`s3://bucketname`. File operations operate on objects. Object creation,
reading, writing, deletion, stat and directory listing is supported.
